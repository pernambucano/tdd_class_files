Three laws of TDD:
> You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
> You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.
> You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

The test is the question you are asking 
your code is the answer to the question. 
By having a clear question, you can always check that your code is working, 
because it consistently gives you the same answer(s) ... no surprises, even when you're working with a large, inter-dependent code base!
